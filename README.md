In the realm of web development, Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) have emerged as a powerful approach to building web applications that offer a native app-like experience to users. Leveraging technologies like Service Workers, Manifest files, and caching strategies, PWAs combine the best of web and mobile applications.

Create-React-App, a popular tool for setting up React projects, provides a seamless way to develop PWAs. By following best practices and utilizing the right resources, developers can enhance their applications with features like offline support, push notifications, and fast loading times.

**Key takeaways from the resources shared include:**

-> **Service Worker Registration:** The Service Worker API enables offline functionality and background synchronization. Proper registration is crucial for PWAs to function correctly.

==> **To set up this project, please follow the steps below.**

1) Clone this repo.
2) Npm i 
3) For Development server need to run npm start.
4) For production server need to run npm run build.
5) For run production build run in local run serve -s build.
